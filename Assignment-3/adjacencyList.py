"""
Given an array of pairs of values representing edges in an unweighted graph, 
create the equivalent adjacency list/set representation 
(a map from element to a list or set of elements). 
Pairs represent directed edges: (A, B) means there is an edge from A to B. 
If the pair (B, A) is also provided then there is an undirected edge between A and B. 
For simplicity, you may assume that each node of the graph stores an integer 
rather than a generic data type and that the elements are distinct. 
Implement a basic DFS and BFS searching for a target value and a 
topological sort (using either DFS or Kahnâ€™s algorithm).
